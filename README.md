# Nasa APIs NodeJS
This NodeJS App was made to test out and use the [APIs that NASA has to offer](https://api.nasa.gov/)

## Technologies Used
The project uses information from [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/). 

It is built using NodeJS
- To build, download the code and install npm v10.8.2 (or later, but this is the old version I use)
- Then, from the folder NasaApis/ open a terminal and run `npm install` or `npm -i`
- To run, open a terminal in the folder with App.js and run the command  `node App.js`
