# Nasa APIs NodeJS
This NodeJS App was made to test out and use the [APIs that NASA has to offer](https://api.nasa.gov/)

## Technologies Used
The project was built as a Node JS application that uses information from [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/). I used some open source designs from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). I also used basic HTML and CSS for the front end. 

### Apis Implemented So Far...
- [All of The AsteroidNeoWs APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/#browseAPI)
- [The Notifications, Cornonal Mass Ejections (CME), GeoMagnetic Storm (GMS) and the Interplanetary Shock (IPS) APIs for DONKI](https://api.nasa.gov/#browseAPI)

I have also started a basic front end with HTML, CSS, Javascript and [W3Schools](https://)

## Build
It is built using NodeJS
- To build, download the code and install npm v10.8.2 (or later, but this is the old version I use)
- Then, from the folder NasaApis/ open a terminal and run `npm install` or `npm -i`
- To run, open a terminal in the folder with App.js and run the command  `node App.js`
