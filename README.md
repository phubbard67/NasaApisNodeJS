# Walking Stalking Robots Website
I built this website for my band [Walking Stalking Robots](https://walkingstalkingrobots.com)

## Technologies Used
The project uses information from [NASA]([https://www.noaa.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/)). 

It is built using NodeJS
- To build, download the code and install npm v10.8.2 (or later, but this is the old version I use)
- Then, from the folder NasaApis/ open a terminal and run `npm install` or `npm -i`
- To run, open a terminal in the folder with App.js and run the command  `node App.js`
